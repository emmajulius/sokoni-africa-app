## Where to Find Your Service

### Step 1: Access Render Dashboard

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**

### Step 2: Find Your Service

You should see a list of services. Look for:
- **Service name**: `sokoni-africa-app` (or whatever you named it)
- **Type**: Should say "Web Service"

**If you don't see any services:**
- You might need to create the service first
- Or it might be in a different team/account

## What You Should See

After clicking your service, you'll see several sections:

### Top Section (Service Header)
- Service name
- Service type (Web Service)
- **Status indicator** (this is what we're looking for!)

### Main Tabs
- **Overview** (default)
- **Logs**
- **Build Logs**
- **Metrics**
- **Settings**
- **Events**

## Where to Find Status

The status appears in different places depending on Render's UI:

### Option 1: Top Right Corner
- Look at the **top right** of the service page
- Might show: "Live", "Building", "Failed", etc.

### Option 2: Next to Service Name
- Look **next to or below** the service name at the top
- Might be a colored dot or badge

### Option 3: Overview Tab
- Click **"Overview"** tab
- Status should be shown there

### Option 4: Service List
- Go back to the main dashboard (list of services)
- Status might be shown as a colored dot next to the service name
